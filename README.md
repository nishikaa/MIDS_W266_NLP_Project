# MIDS_W266_NLP_Project

Final project of MIDS - UC Berkeley DATASCI 266 Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning. 

This research presents a comprehensive analysis of multiclass sentiment analysis models by comparing Word2Vec-based LSTM, BiLSTM, and BERT-based models. The study aims to determine the model that best captures sentiment nuances from text data. Through thorough evaluation, the BERT-BiLSTM hybrid model emerges as the top performer, achieving a precision and F1-score of 0.82, coupled with a recall of 0.81. This outcome underscores the synergy between BERT's contextual embeddings and BiLSTM's sequential understanding, making the BERT-BiLSTM model the optimal choice for accurate and nuanced sentiment classification tasks.
